    "\n",
    "- **Phase 1 — Introduction → Discovery (`t_int` → `t_f`):**  \n",
    "  The vulnerability is introduced into a product (at time `t_int`) and remains undetected until it is discovered (at time `t_f`).  \n",
    "  This phase ends when the vulnerability is first found by any party.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase 2 — Private Knowledge (`t_f` → `t_d`):**  \n",
    "  The vulnerability is known to at least one individual or organization but has **not yet been publicly disclosed**.  \n",
    "  During this period, exploitation risk depends on the discoverer’s intent (ethical researcher vs. malicious actor).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase 3 — Public Disclosure → Patch Release (`t_d` → `t_fix`):**  \n",
    "  Begins once the vulnerability becomes **publicly known** (at `t_d`) and lasts until a **patch or fix** is published (at `t_fix`).  \n",
    "  This phase can be eliminated if the vendor discloses and fixes the issue simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase 4 — Patch Release → Full Remediation (`t_fix` → `t_p`):**  \n",
    "  Covers the period after the fix is released until **all affected hosts have applied the patch** (at `t_p`).  \n",
    "  The duration depends on users’ update behavior and deployment speed.\n",

    "- In **responsible disclosure**, Phase 3 may be skipped entirely (disclosure and fix occur together).  \n",
    "- In some **proprietary software**, vulnerabilities may be **silently patched**—public disclosure never occurs, so the lifecycle differs."

    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 Motivation\n",
    "Finding the *exact* commit that introduced a vulnerability (VCC) is difficult and often unreliable for large datasets.  \n",
    "Instead of identifying one exact commit, the authors aimed to **approximate the introduction time** of a vulnerability — good enough to estimate its lifetime accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚙️ Method Overview\n",
    "They **repurposed and modified** the `VCCFinder` heuristic to estimate *how long* code was vulnerable rather than pinpointing an exact VCC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Use `git blame`** on the fixing commit to identify potential VCCs (commits responsible for vulnerable lines).  \n",
    "2. **Filter out irrelevant data:**\n",
    "   - Ignore **test files**, **non–C/C++ files**, **comments**, and **empty lines**.\n",
    "3. **Blame logic for identifying likely VCCs:**\n",
    "   - **Removed lines** → always blamed.\n",
    "   - **Added code blocks (≥2 lines)** → blame lines *before and after* the addition (unless it’s a function definition).\n",
    "   - **Single-line additions** → blame if they contain control-flow keywords  \n",
    "     (`if`, `else`, `goto`, `return`, `sizeof`, `break`, `NULL`) or **function calls**.\n",
    "4. **Calculate estimated introduction date (`dₕ`):**\n",
    "   - Take the **weighted average** of all blamed commit dates.  \n",
    "   - Weight = number of times each commit was blamed.  \n",
    "   - Convert all dates into “days since Jan 1, 1900” for consistent calculation.\n",

    "- **Average lifetime overestimated by only ~117 days** (vs. underestimation of ~347 days previously).\n",
    "- **Error distribution is symmetric**, meaning over- and underestimates cancel out.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧮 Why It’s Statistically More Reliable\n",
    "- Follows the **Central Limit Theorem** — averaging multiple samples reduces noise.  \n",
    "- Treats individual errors as **independent random variables**, so they cancel out on average.  \n",
    "- Requires a **minimum of 20 samples** to ensure statistical validity, though most analyses used 60+.  \n",
    "- Performs consistently across **different projects** (Linux Kernel, Chromium, Apache).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚧 Concerns Addressed\n",
    "- **Overfitting / Project Dependency:**  \n",
    "  Older “constant offset” corrections failed when applied to different projects; the new method works **without tuning**.\n",
    "- **Small-sample unreliability:**  \n",
    "  Large standard deviation (>900 days) in individual samples led them to use mean values across multiple CVEs.\n",
    "- **Cross-project generalization:**  \n",
    "  The method works consistently across projects, unlike additive-correction approaches that required recalibration.\n",
    "- **Trend and Distribution Analysis:**  \n",
    "  The heuristic preserved the **shape of lifetime distributions** and accurately reflected **trends over time**, confirmed via:\n",
    "  - Similar **linear trends** between estimated and ground truth lifetimes.\n",
    "  - Comparable **histogram and exponential fits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ **Conclusion**\n",
    "The **weighted average heuristic** provides:\n",
    "- A **scalable**, **tuning-free**, and **statistically robust** way to estimate vulnerability lifetimes.\n",
    "- Significant improvement over older `git blame`-based approaches.\n",
    "- Reliable performance across projects, allowing for accurate **trend** and **distribution** analysis at scale."
