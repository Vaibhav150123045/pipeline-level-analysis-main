    "\n",
    "#### üß† Motivation\n",
    "Finding the *exact* commit that introduced a vulnerability (VCC) is difficult and often unreliable for large datasets.  \n",
    "Instead of identifying one exact commit, the authors aimed to **approximate the introduction time** of a vulnerability ‚Äî good enough to estimate its lifetime accurately.\n",

    "They **repurposed and modified** the `VCCFinder` heuristic to estimate *how long* code was vulnerable rather than pinpointing an exact VCC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Use `git blame`** on the fixing commit to identify potential VCCs (commits responsible for vulnerable lines).  \n",
    "2. **Filter out irrelevant data:**\n",
    "   - Ignore **test files**, **non‚ÄìC/C++ files**, **comments**, and **empty lines**.\n",
    "3. **Blame logic for identifying likely VCCs:**\n",
    "   - **Removed lines** ‚Üí always blamed.\n",
    "   - **Added code blocks (‚â•2 lines)** ‚Üí blame lines *before and after* the addition (unless it‚Äôs a function definition).\n",
    "   - **Single-line additions** ‚Üí blame if they contain control-flow keywords  \n",
    "     (`if`, `else`, `goto`, `return`, `sizeof`, `break`, `NULL`) or **function calls**.\n",
    "4. **Calculate estimated introduction date (`d‚Çï`):**\n",
    "   - Take the **weighted average** of all blamed commit dates.  \n",
    "   - Weight = number of times each commit was blamed.  \n",
    "   - Convert all dates into ‚Äúdays since Jan 1, 1900‚Äù for consistent calculation.\n",

    "- **Mean error reduced by 66%.**\n",
    "- **Average lifetime overestimated by only ~117 days** (vs. underestimation of ~347 days previously).\n",

    "- Requires a **minimum of 20 samples** to ensure statistical validity, though most analyses used 60+.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üöß Concerns Addressed\n",
    "- **Overfitting / Project Dependency:**  \n",
    "  Older ‚Äúconstant offset‚Äù corrections failed when applied to different projects; the new method works **without tuning**.\n",
    "- **Small-sample unreliability:**  \n",
    "  Large standard deviation (>900 days) in individual samples led them to use mean values across multiple CVEs.\n",
    "- **Cross-project generalization:**  \n",
    "  The method works consistently across projects, unlike additive-correction approaches that required recalibration.\n",
    "- **Trend and Distribution Analysis:**  \n",
    "  The heuristic preserved the **shape of lifetime distributions** and accurately reflected **trends over time**, confirmed via:\n",
    "  - Similar **linear trends** between estimated and ground truth lifetimes.\n",
    "  - Comparable **histogram and exponential fits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ **Conclusion**\n",
    "The **weighted average heuristic** provides:\n",
    "- A **scalable**, **tuning-free**, and **statistically robust** way to estimate vulnerability lifetimes.\n",
    "- Significant improvement over older `git blame`-based approaches.\n",
    "- Reliable performance across projects, allowing for accurate **trend** and **distribution** analysis at scale."
