Dear Prof. Salanti and Dr. Papakonstantinou,
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Web Developer position for the GALENOS project at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern. As a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Bern with a background in Mathematics and Computing from IIT India, I bring a unique blend of statistical modeling, full-stack development, and reproducible research workflows that I am eager to apply toward GALENOS’s mission of transparent and FAIR-aligned evidence synthesis.
Currently, I am available to contribute immediately at 40% capacity, with full-time availability from July 2025 upon completion of my degree. My academic focus has been on applied machine learning and statistical modeling, with projects spanning deep learning, federated learning, and traditional inference techniques. I’ve worked extensively with regression models, clustering algorithms, time series forecasting, ensemble methods, and probabilistic generative models such as VAEs. These experiences have deepened my understanding of reproducible statistical workflows, and I’ve complemented them by publishing Python packages that encapsulate preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation pipelines—skills directly relevant to GALENOS’s interactive research platform.
Professionally, I bring over five years of full-stack development experience across finance, healthcare, and data platforms. At MeiMed, I independently developed a full-stack data processing web application that ingested medical billing data and produced statistical analyses, applying visualization and reporting tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. I performed hypothesis testing, dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP), and hierarchical clustering to segment customer behavior—an experience that sharpened my ability to translate statistical models into actionable insights.
At Trestle IQ, I orchestrated large-scale data integration pipelines using Spring Batch and AWS EC2 clusters, strengthening my expertise in containerization with Docker and orchestration concepts. Earlier, at Barclays, I contributed to the development of a mobile banking application during the COVID-19 surge, optimizing React/Redux frontend performance for over 10 million monthly users. I also designed and integrated REST APIs with Java Spring Boot, gaining exposure to systems architecture and backend scalability. Across these roles, I’ve consistently practiced Git with branching strategies and maintained clear documentation in Markdown.
My quantitative aptitude is reflected in a GRE score of 324, including a perfect 170 in quantitative reasoning (top 3% globally). I ranked among the top 0.1% of 1.3 million IIT-JEE candidates to enter the Indian Institute of Technology, where I completed my Bachelor’s in Mathematics and Computing.
With a profile built at the intersection of web development, software engineering, statistical modeling, and machine learning, I am deeply motivated to contribute to GALENOS’s interdisciplinary vision. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with your team to build tools that promote transparency, reproducibility, and verifiability in mental health research.
